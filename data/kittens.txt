Exploding Kittens

the rules
players: 2-10
contents: 122 cards.

how it works:

In the deck of cards are some
Exploding Kittens. You play the game
by putting the deck face down and taking
turns drawing cards until someone draws
an Exploding Kitten.

PARTY PACK!


setup:

To start, remove all the Exploding Kittens (9)
from the deck and set them aside.

taking your turn:
Gather all 8 of your cards into your hand
and look at them. Do one of the following:

PASS:

Now, look through the remaining deck and
based on the number of players, use the
following cards:

2 - 3 players: Use only the cards WITH a
paw print in the corner.
nope

Play no cards.

Play a card by placing it FACE UP on
top of the Discard Pile and following
the instructions on the card.

feed your opponent a nope sandwich
with extra nopesauce

4 - 7 players: Use only the cards WITHOUT
a paw print in the corner.

8 - 10 players: Use all of the cards.

this at any time.

can play
Remove all You of
the Defuse Cards from
the deck and deal 1 to each player.

When that happens, that person explodes.
They are now dead and out of the game.

Insert any extra Defuse Cards back
in the deck (if there are any).
Stop the action of another Player.
You can play this at any time.

Read the text on a card to
learn what it does.

After you follow the instructions on the
card, you can play another card. You
can play as many cards as you’d like.
End your turn by drawing a card from the
top of the Draw Pile into your hand and
hoping it’s not an Exploding Kitten.
(This is different from most games in that
you END YOUR TURN by drawing a card.)


Each player starts with a Defuse Card; the most
powerful card in the game. These are the only
cards that can save you from Exploding Kittens.
If you draw an Exploding Kitten, instead of dying,
you can play the Defuse Card and reinsert the
Kitten back into the Draw Pile anywhere you’d like
in secret.
Try to get as many Defuse Cards as possible.

This process continues until there’s only
1 player left, who wins the game.
The more cards you draw, the greater your
chances of drawing an Exploding Kitten.


Shuffle the deck and deal 7 cards face down
to each player. Everyone now has a hand
of 8 cards total (including the Defuse Card).
Insert enough Exploding Kittens back into
the deck so that there is 1 fewer than the
number of people playing. Remove any
extra Exploding Kittens from the game.

if you explode, you lose.

and you are full of incendiary loser sadsauce.

if you don’t explode, YOU WIN.

and you are full of greatness. good job, buddy.

and all of the other cards
Will Lessen Your Chances of Getting
Exploded by Exploding Kittens.

For example
You could use a See the Future
Card to peek at the top few
cards in the Draw Pile. If that
reveals an Exploding Kitten,
you could then use a Skip Card
to end your turn and
avoid drawing it.

For a 4 player game, insert 3 Kittens.
For a 3 player game, insert 2 Kittens.

This ensures that everyone eventually
explodes except for 1 person.
Note: For a 2 - 3 player game, the Exploding Kittens you
insert will be the only cards that do not have paw prints.

Shuffle the deck, and put it face down
in the middle of the table.
This is your Draw Pile.

(Be sure to leave some space for a Discard Pile as well.)

Pick a player to go first. (Some sample
criteria: most impressive beard, most
intimidating odor, shortest spleen, etc.)

Play continues clockwise around the table.

Play as many or as few cards as you’d like, then
draw a card to end your turn.

Pass-or-Play then Draw.
Pass-or-Play then Draw.

Ending the game
The last player who hasn't exploded
wins the game.

You won't ever run out of cards in the
Draw Pile because you inserted enough
Exploding Kittens to kill all but 1 player.

Three more things
A good strategy is to save your cards early in
the game while your chance of exploding is low.
You can always count the cards left in the
Draw Pile to figure out the odds of exploding.
There is no maximum or minimum hand size.
If you run out of cards in your hand, there’s no
special action to take. Keep playing. You’ll
draw at least 1 more card on your next turn.

Example Turn
You suspect the top card in the draw pile is an
Exploding Kitten, so instead of passing and then
drawing a card to end your turn, you decide to play a

If you drew an Exploding Kitten, you can play
this card instead of dying. Place your Defuse
Card in the
Discard Pile.
Then take the Exploding Kitten, and without
reordering or viewing the other cards, secretly
put it back in the Draw Pile anywhere you’d like.

Want to hurt the player right after you? Put the
Kitten right on top of the deck. If you’d like,
hold the deck under the table so that no one
else can see where you put it.
Your turn is over after playing this card.

Playing matching Pairs of Cat Cards (where you get to
steal a random card from another player) no longer only
applies to pairs of Cat Cards. It now
applies to ANY pair of cards with the
same title (a pair of Shuffle Cards, a
pair of Skip Cards, etc).

If you play 5 different cards (any 5 cards with different
titles), go through the Discard Pile to take
any single card you'd like.
(Grab the Pile quickly to choose your
card so that you don't get 'Noped!')
